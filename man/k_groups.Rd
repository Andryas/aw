\title{Divide Sequence into K Groups}
\usage{
k_groups(n, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer specifying the length of the sequence.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of groups to divide the sequence into.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector indicating the group assignment for each element in the sequence.
}
\description{
This function divides a sequence of integers from 1 to n into k groups,
ensuring a balanced distribution across the groups as much as possible.
}
\details{
The function assigns each element in the sequence an integer value indicating its group assignment.
The assignment is done in such a way that each group contains approximately the same number of elements.
If n is not divisible by k, the remaining elements are distributed evenly across the groups.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Divide a sequence of 10 integers into 3 groups
group_assignment <- k_groups(10, 3)
}
