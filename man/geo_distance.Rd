\title{Calculate Geographic Distance between Two Points}
\usage{
geo_distance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat1}{Latitude of the first point.}

\item{lng1}{Longitude of the first point.}

\item{lat2}{Latitude of the second point.}

\item{lng2}{Longitude of the second point.}
}
\value{
The geographic distance between the two points in kilometers.
}
\description{
This function calculates the geographic distance between two points specified by their latitude and longitude.
}
\details{
The function uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on the surface of a sphere,
such as the Earth. The result is the distance in kilometers.
